This is a 2D game which has you control a player in a defined play area to pick up multiple targets. 
The game lasts 60 seconds to see how many targets you can pick up.

It was made in C# using the Monogame DesktopGL Framework. It was written and tested in Visual Studio 2019 on a Windows 7 operating system.

I recolored, rotated, and resized each image using GIMP 2.10.

I created the rainbowStrip texture for the walls on my own.
